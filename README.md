# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi Man!

It's just my first try and experience.
Github looks like a new world to me, it provides me with a brand new storage method. And it also opens a window for me to the world, now I can work with many like-minded friends in the world to do what we are interested in.
I am very happy to join this ranks. And I hope that in the future more new ideas, new concepts, new creativities can be foreseen.

That's why I come here. And I think this platform will become better and better.

Best wishes!
